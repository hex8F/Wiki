The Bio-Reactor is a type of [electricity](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Machines) generator. 

## Obtaining
A Bio-Reactor can be crafted in an [Enhanced Crafting Table](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Enhanced-Crafting-Table).

## Usage
A Bio-Reactor must be placed within 7 blocks of an [energy regulator](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Energy-Regulator) or a [capacitor](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Energy-Capacitors) in range of one (in a straight line; no diagonals), and provided with the appropriate fuel.<br>
Once it is placed, right-click it and place fuel in its inventory (two slots on the left).

## Tiers
